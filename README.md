📘 Introduction

In Python, a variable is simply a name that stores a value.
You can think of it as a label attached to a piece of data stored in memory.

x = 10
message = "Hello World"


Python automatically creates the variable when you assign a value — no need to declare data types.

🧠 What Exactly Is a Variable?

A variable:

Holds data (numbers, text, lists, etc.)

Gives that data a name

Allows you to use and manipulate the data later

Example:

name = "Ravi"
age = 21


Here,
name → holds text
age → holds a number

x = 5


This means:

Python stores the value 5 somewhere in memory

Python creates a label named x

Python makes x point to the stored value# python
