🔑 Python Keywords

Keywords are predefined, reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers.

Examples of Python Keywords:

None, and, as, assert, break, continue, def, del, except, for,
from, global, in, lambda, nonlocal, raise, try, while, yield,
True, False, async, await, class, elif, else, finally, if,
import, is, not, pass, return, with

🆔 Identifiers

Identifiers are the names given to entities such as variables, functions, and classes.

Types of Identifiers

Variable Identifier

age = 25

Function / Method Identifier

def calculate_area(length, width):
    return length * width

Class Identifier

class Student:
    pass


---

📏 Rules for Identifiers

Must start with a letter or underscore (_)

Can contain letters, digits, and underscores

Cannot start with a digit

No special characters (@, #, $, etc.)

Case-sensitive (age, Age, AGE are different)

Cannot use Python keywords



---

🔄 Variables vs Identifiers

Identifiers are names given to variables, functions, classes, etc.

Variables are a specific type of identifier used to store and manipulate data.


Example:

a = 10


---

🔒 Constants

Constants are a special type of variable whose value should not be changed during program execution.

Example:

PI = 3.14

(Note: Python does not enforce constants, but uppercase names are used by convention.)


---

🧱 Literals

Literals are fixed values used directly in a program.

Types of Literals:

Numeric literals

Character literals

String literals


Examples:

a = 100
name = "John"
