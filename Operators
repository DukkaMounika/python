🐍 Python Operators

🔢 Types of Operators in Python

Python supports 7 types of operators:

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment Operators
3. Comparison Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Membership Operators
6. Identity Operators
7. Bitwise Operators


1️⃣ Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform mathematical operations.

Operator	Description

1. +	Addition
2. -	Subtraction
3. *	Multiplication
4. /	Division (returns float)
5. //	Floor Division
6. %	Modulus (remainder)
7. **	Exponentiation

Example:

a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)
print(a // b)
print(a ** b)


2️⃣ Assignment Operators

Used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Example	Meaning

1. =	a = 10	Assign
2. +=	a += b	a = a + b
3. -=	a -= b	a = a - b
4. *=	a *= b	a = a * b
5. /=	a /= b	a = a / b
6. //=	a //= b	a = a // b
7. %=	a %= b	a = a % b
8. **=	a **= b	a = a ** b


3️⃣ Comparison Operators

Used to compare two values.

Operator	Description

1. ==	Equal to
2. !=	Not equal to
3. >	Greater than
4. <	Less than
5. >=	Greater than or equal to
6. <=	Less than or equal to

Example:

a = 10
b = 20
print(a < b)


4️⃣ Logical Operators

Used to combine conditional statements.

Operator	Description

1. and:	True if both conditions are true
2. or	: True if at least one condition is true
not	Reverses the result

Example:

a = True
b = False
print(a and b)


5️⃣ Membership Operators

Used to test if a value exists in a sequence.

Operator	Description

1. in:	    True if value is present
2. not in:	True if value is not present

Example:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
print(2 in nums)


6️⃣ Identity Operators

Used to compare memory location of objects.

Operator	Description

1. is:	  True if both variables refer to same object
2.is not:	True if different objects

Example:
a = 10
b = 10
print(a is b)


7️⃣ Bitwise Operators

Used to perform operations at bit level.

Operator	Description

1. &	Bitwise AND
2. ^	Bitwise XOR
3. ~	Bitwise NOT
4. <<	Left shift
5. >>	Right shift

Example:
a = 5
b = 3
print(a & b)


📊 Operator Precedence (High → Low)

1. **
2. Unary operators (+x, -x, ~x)
3. *, /, //, %
4. +, -
5. <<, >>
6. &
7. ^
8. |
9. Comparison operators
10. not


11. and


12. or
13.
