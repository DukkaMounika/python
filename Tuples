📦 Python Tuples

📌 Introduction

A tuple is a built-in data type in Python used to store multiple values in a single variable.
Any values written inside parentheses () are considered a tuple.

🧾 Tuple Characteristics

Tuples are written using parentheses ()

Can store multiple data types:

int
float
string
boolean

Supports:

Indexing
Slicing
Skipping


Memory allocation behavior is similar to strings and lists

Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation)


🧪 Example
t = (10, 20, 30)
print(t)
Output:
(10, 20, 30)


🔧 Built-in Functions in Tuple

Python provides limited built-in functions for tuples:

1️⃣ count()
      Returns the number of times a value appears in a tuple.
Example:
t = (1, 2, 2, 3)
print(t.count(2))

2️⃣ index()
    Returns the index position of the first occurrence of a value.
Example:
t = (10, 20, 30)
print(t.index(20))

✅ Advantage of Tuples

Tuples are useful when multiple values are assigned to a single variable
Python automatically converts them into a tuple

Example:
a = 10, 20, 30
print(a)
Output:
(10, 20, 30)


🎒 Packing and Unpacking

Packing

t = 1, 2, 3

Unpacking

a, b, c = t
print(a, b, c)
