🔄 Variables vs Identifiers

Identifiers are names given to variables, functions, classes, etc.

Variables are a specific type of identifier used to store and manipulate data.


Example:

a = 10

🔒 Constants

Constants are a special type of variable whose value should not be changed during program execution.

Example:

PI = 3.14

(Note: Python does not enforce constants, but uppercase names are used by convention.)

🧱 Literals

Literals are fixed values used directly in a program.

Types of Literals:

Numeric literals
